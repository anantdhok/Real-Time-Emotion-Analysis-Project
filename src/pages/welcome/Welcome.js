            Our project would help psychologists with their study on their patients, by facilitating features such as
            real time emotion detection during video one-to-one sessions. Through which the doctor would get greater
            insights about how his/her therapy and words are having the effect on the concerned person.
            <br />
            <br />
            All the existing software for this purpose only provides basic features such as scheduling meetings, note
            taking provision, e-prescription, etc. Emotion detection is also possible using a microcontroller unit to do
            the processing and stand-alone camera but this apparatus wouldnâ€™t be practical for everyone. On the other
            hand, our project will have the feature of emotion detection using speech and video in real time, processed
            on cloud.
